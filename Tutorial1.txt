# Firstly, Thank you for using my application
# This is the tutorial of how to use it properly
-  When you first open the aplication, a small window will appear 
-  And you have to type in some information about your name, your age,... and then "Enter" it
-  Don't worry, I am not gonna take your information 
-  Instead, it's will be saved on your computer as a .csv file called Body Mass Index.csv
+ which would take 1-2 kbytes of your storage

-  There are 2 more functions called :
+ Making Plot which will create a graph of your BMI day by day
+ Status History which will literally show you your BMI history so you can check your old BMI.
